# NGINX Documentation repository 

This directory contains the documentation for the NGINX Documentation repository.

It's used by the DocOps team to record how we configure our tools and instructions for certain precise tasks.

There's also documentation around our ways of working, and ideas of significance wider than the scope of an issue or pull request.

We maintain this information publicly as part of NGINX's commitment to transparency and open source.

If you're interested in contributing to the [NGINX documentation website](https://docs.nginx.com/), check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
