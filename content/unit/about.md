# Universal web app server

NGINX Unit is a lightweight and versatile application runtime that provides the
essential components for your web application as a single open-source server:
running application code (including WebAssembly), serving static assets,
handling TLS and request routing.

Unit was created by [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) team members from scratch to
be highly efficient and fully configurable at runtime.
