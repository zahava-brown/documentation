## About
[//]: # "These are Markdown comments to guide you through document structure. Remove them as you go, as well as any unnecessary sections."
[//]: # "Use underscores for _italics_, and double asterisks for **bold**."
[//]: # "Backticks are for `monospace`, used sparingly and reserved mostly for executable names - they can cause formatting problems. Avoid them in tables: use italics instead."

NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

NGINX Plus adds a range of premium features to address enterprise needs.

## Featured content
[//]: # "You can add a maximum of three cards: any extra will not display."
[//]: # "One card will take full width page: two will take half width each. Three will stack like an inverse pyramid."
[//]: # "Some examples of content could be the latest release note, the most common install path, and a popular new feature."
