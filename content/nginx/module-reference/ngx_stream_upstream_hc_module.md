## `health_check`

**Syntax:** [*`parameters`*]

**Contexts:** `server`

Enables periodic health checks of the servers in a
[group](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_module.html#upstream).

The following optional parameters are supported:
- `interval`=*`time`*

    sets the interval between two consecutive health checks,
    by default, 5 seconds.
- `jitter`=*`time`*

    sets the time within which
    each health check will be randomly delayed,
    by default, there is no delay.
- `fails`=*`number`*

    sets the number of consecutive failed health checks of a particular server
    after which this server will be considered unhealthy,
    by default, 1.
- `passes`=*`number`*

    sets the number of consecutive passed health checks of a particular server
    after which the server will be considered healthy,
    by default, 1.
- `mandatory` [`persistent`]

    sets the initial “checking” state for a server
    until the first health check is completed (1.11.7).
    Client connections are not passed to servers in the “checking” state.
    If the parameter is not specified,
    the server will be initially considered healthy.
    
    
    
    The `persistent` parameter (1.21.1)
    sets the initial “up” state for a server after reload
    if the server was considered healthy before reload.
- `match`=*`name`*

    specifies the `match` block configuring the tests that a
    successful connection should pass in order for a health check to pass.
    By default, for TCP, only the ability
    to establish a TCP connection with the server is checked.
    For [UDP](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check_udp), the absence of
    ICMP “`Destination Unreachable`” message is expected
    in reply to the sent string “`nginx health check`”.
    > Prior to version 1.11.7, by default, UDP health check
    > required a [match](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hc_module.html#hc_match) block with the
    > [send](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hc_module.html#match_send) and [expect](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hc_module.html#match_expect)
    > parameters.
- `port`=*`number`*

    defines the port used when connecting to a server
    to perform a health check (1.9.7).
    By default, equals the
    [`server`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_module.html#server) port.
- `udp`

    specifies that the `UDP` protocol should be used for
    health checks instead of the default `TCP` protocol (1.9.13).

## `health_check_timeout`

**Syntax:** *`timeout`*

**Default:** 5s

**Contexts:** `stream, server`

Overrides the
[`proxy_timeout`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_proxy_module.html#proxy_timeout)
value for health checks.

## `match`

**Syntax:** *`name`* `{...}`

**Contexts:** `stream`

Defines the named test set used to verify server responses to health checks.

The following parameters can be configured:
- `send` *`string`*;

    sends a *`string`* to the server;
- `expect` *`string`* |
`~` *`regex`*;

    a literal string (1.9.12) or a regular expression
    that the data obtained from the server should match.
    The regular expression is specified with the preceding
    “`~*`” modifier (for case-insensitive matching), or the
    “`~`” modifier (for case-sensitive matching).

Both `send` and `expect` parameters
can contain hexadecimal literals with the prefix “`\x`”
followed by two hex digits, for example, “`\x80`” (1.9.12).

Health check is passed if:
- the TCP connection was successfully established;
- the *`string`* from the `send` parameter,
    if specified, was sent;
- the data obtained from the server matched the string or regular expression
    from the `expect` parameter, if specified;
- the time elapsed does not exceed the value specified
    in the [`health_check_timeout`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check_timeout) directive.

Example:
```
upstream backend {
    zone     upstream_backend 10m;
    server   127.0.0.1:12345;
}

match http {
    send     "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n";
    expect ~ "200 OK";
}

server {
    listen       12346;
    proxy_pass   backend;
    health_check match=http;
}
```

> Only the first
> [`proxy_buffer_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffer_size)
> bytes of data obtained from the server are examined.
