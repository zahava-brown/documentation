## `geo`

**Syntax:** [*`$address`*] *`$variable`* `{...}`

**Contexts:** `stream`

Describes the dependency of values of the specified variable
on the client IP address.
By default, the address is taken from the `$remote_addr` variable,
but it can also be taken from another variable, for example:
```
geo $arg_remote_addr $geo {
    ...;
}
```

> Since variables are evaluated only when used, the mere existence
> of even a large number of declared “`geo`” variables
> does not cause any extra costs for connection processing.

If the value of a variable does not represent a valid IP address
then the “`255.255.255.255`” address is used.

Addresses are specified either as prefixes in CIDR notation
(including individual addresses) or as ranges.

The following special parameters are also supported:
- `delete`

    deletes the specified network.
- `default`

    a value set to the variable if the client address does not
    match any of the specified addresses.
    When addresses are specified in CIDR notation,
    “`0.0.0.0/0`” and “`::/0`”
    can be used instead of `default`.
    When `default` is not specified, the default
    value will be an empty string.
- `include`

    includes a file with addresses and values.
    There can be several inclusions.
- `ranges`

    indicates that addresses are specified as ranges.
    This parameter should be the first.
    To speed up loading of a geo base, addresses should be put in ascending order.

Example:
```
geo $country {
    default        ZZ;
    include        conf/geo.conf;
    delete         127.0.0.0/16;

    127.0.0.0/24   US;
    127.0.0.1/32   RU;
    10.1.0.0/16    RU;
    192.168.1.0/24 UK;
}
```

The `conf/geo.conf` file could contain the following lines:
```
10.2.0.0/16    RU;
192.168.2.0/24 RU;
```

A value of the most specific match is used.
For example, for the 127.0.0.1 address the value “`RU`”
will be chosen, not “`US`”.

Example with ranges:
```
geo $country {
    ranges;
    default                   ZZ;
    127.0.0.0-127.0.0.0       US;
    127.0.0.1-127.0.0.1       RU;
    127.0.0.1-127.0.0.255     US;
    10.1.0.0-10.1.255.255     RU;
    192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255 UK;
}
```
