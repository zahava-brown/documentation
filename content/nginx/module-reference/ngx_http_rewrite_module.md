## `break`

**Contexts:** `server, location, if`

Stops processing the current set of
`ngx_http_rewrite_module` directives.

If a directive is specified inside the
[`location`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location),
further processing of the request continues in this location.

Example:
```
if ($slow) {
    limit_rate 10k;
    break;
}
```

## `if`

**Syntax:** (*`condition`*) `{...}`

**Contexts:** `server, location`

The specified *`condition`* is evaluated.
If true, this module directives specified inside the braces are
executed, and the request is assigned the configuration inside the
`if` directive.
Configurations inside the `if` directives are
inherited from the previous configuration level.

A condition may be any of the following:
- a variable name; false if the value of a variable is an empty string
    or “`0`”;
    > Before version 1.0.1, any string starting with “`0`”
    > was considered a false value.
- comparison of a variable with a string using the
    “`=`” and “`!=`” operators;
- matching of a variable against a regular expression using the
    “`~`” (for case-sensitive matching) and
    “`~*`” (for case-insensitive matching) operators.
    Regular expressions can contain captures that are made available for
    later reuse in the `$1`..`$9` variables.
    Negative operators “`!~`” and “`!~*`”
    are also available.
    If a regular expression includes the “`}`”
    or “`;`” characters, the whole expressions should be enclosed
    in single or double quotes.
- checking of a file existence with the “`-f`” and
    “`!-f`” operators;
- checking of a directory existence with the “`-d`” and
    “`!-d`” operators;
- checking of a file, directory, or symbolic link existence with the
    “`-e`” and “`!-e`” operators;
- checking for an executable file with the “`-x`”
    and “`!-x`” operators.

Examples:
```
if ($http_user_agent ~ MSIE) {
    rewrite ^(.*)$ /msie/$1 break;
}

if ($http_cookie ~* "id=([^;]+)(?:;|$)") {
    set $id $1;
}

if ($request_method = POST) {
    return 405;
}

if ($slow) {
    limit_rate 10k;
}

if ($invalid_referer) {
    return 403;
}
```
> A value of the `$invalid_referer` embedded variable is set by the
> [`valid_referers`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_referer_module.html#valid_referers) directive.

## `return`

**Syntax:** *`code`* [*`text`*]

**Contexts:** `server, location, if`

Stops processing and returns the specified *`code`* to a client.
The non-standard code 444 closes a connection without sending
a response header.

Starting from version 0.8.42, it is possible to specify
either a redirect URL (for codes 301, 302, 303, 307, and 308)
or the response body *`text`* (for other codes).
A response body text and redirect URL can contain variables.
As a special case, a redirect URL can be specified as a URI
local to this server, in which case the full redirect URL
is formed according to the request scheme (`$scheme`) and the
[`server_name_in_redirect`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_name_in_redirect) and
[`port_in_redirect`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#port_in_redirect) directives.

In addition, a *`URL`* for temporary redirect with the code 302
can be specified as the sole parameter.
Such a parameter should start with the “`http://`”,
“`https://`”, or “`$scheme`” string.
A *`URL`* can contain variables.

> Only the following codes could be returned before version 0.7.51:
> 204, 400, 402 — 406, 408, 410, 411, 413, 416, and 500 — 504.


> The code 307 was not treated as a redirect until versions 1.1.16 and 1.0.13.


> The code 308 was not treated as a redirect until version 1.13.0.

See also the [`error_page`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#error_page) directive.

## `rewrite`

**Syntax:** *`regex`* *`replacement`* [*`flag`*]

**Contexts:** `server, location, if`

If the specified regular expression matches a request URI, URI is changed
as specified in the *`replacement`* string.
The `rewrite` directives are executed sequentially
in order of their appearance in the configuration file.
It is possible to terminate further processing of the directives using flags.
If a replacement string starts with “`http://`”,
“`https://`”, or “`$scheme`”,
the processing stops and the redirect is returned to a client.

An optional *`flag`* parameter can be one of:
- `last`

    stops processing the current set of
    `ngx_http_rewrite_module` directives and starts
    a search for a new location matching the changed URI;
- `break`

    stops processing the current set of
    `ngx_http_rewrite_module` directives
    as with the [`break`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html#break) directive;
- `redirect`

    returns a temporary redirect with the 302 code;
    used if a replacement string does not start with
    “`http://`”, “`https://`”,
    or “`$scheme`”;
- `permanent`

    returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.

The full redirect URL is formed according to the
request scheme (`$scheme`) and the
[`server_name_in_redirect`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_name_in_redirect) and
[`port_in_redirect`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#port_in_redirect) directives.

Example:
```
server {
    ...
    rewrite ^(/download/.*)/media/(.*)\..*$ $1/mp3/$2.mp3 last;
    rewrite ^(/download/.*)/audio/(.*)\..*$ $1/mp3/$2.ra  last;
    return  403;
    ...
}
```

But if these directives are put inside the “`/download/`”
location, the `last` flag should be replaced by
`break`, or otherwise nginx will make 10 cycles and
return the 500 error:
```
location /download/ {
    rewrite ^(/download/.*)/media/(.*)\..*$ $1/mp3/$2.mp3 break;
    rewrite ^(/download/.*)/audio/(.*)\..*$ $1/mp3/$2.ra  break;
    return  403;
}
```

If a *`replacement`* string includes the new request arguments,
the previous request arguments are appended after them.
If this is undesired, putting a question mark at the end of a replacement
string avoids having them appended, for example:
```
rewrite ^/users/(.*)$ /show?user=$1? last;
```

If a regular expression includes the “`}`”
or “`;`” characters, the whole expressions should be enclosed
in single or double quotes.

## `rewrite_log`

**Syntax:** `on` | `off`

**Default:** off

**Contexts:** `http, server, location, if`

Enables or disables logging of `ngx_http_rewrite_module`
module directives processing results
into the [`error_log`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#error_log) at
the `notice` level.

## `set`

**Syntax:** *`$variable`* *`value`*

**Contexts:** `server, location, if`

Sets a *`value`* for the specified *`variable`*.
The *`value`* can contain text, variables, and their combination.

## `uninitialized_variable_warn`

**Syntax:** `on` | `off`

**Default:** on

**Contexts:** `http, server, location, if`

Controls whether warnings about uninitialized variables are logged.
