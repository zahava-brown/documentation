## `health_check`

**Syntax:** [*`parameters`*]

**Contexts:** `location`

Enables periodic health checks of the servers in a
[group](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#upstream)
referenced in the surrounding location.

The following optional parameters are supported:
- `interval`=*`time`*

    sets the interval between two consecutive health checks,
    by default, 5 seconds.
- `jitter`=*`time`*

    sets the time within which
    each health check will be randomly delayed,
    by default, there is no delay.
- `fails`=*`number`*

    sets the number of consecutive failed health checks of a particular server
    after which this server will be considered unhealthy,
    by default, 1.
- `passes`=*`number`*

    sets the number of consecutive passed health checks of a particular server
    after which the server will be considered healthy,
    by default, 1.
- `uri`=*`uri`*

    defines the URI used in health check requests,
    by default, “`/`”.
- `mandatory` [`persistent`]

    sets the initial “checking” state for a server
    until the first health check is completed (1.11.7).
    Client requests are not passed to servers in the “checking” state.
    If the parameter is not specified,
    the server will be initially considered healthy.
    
    
    
    The `persistent` parameter (1.19.7)
    sets the initial “up” state for a server after reload
    if the server was considered healthy before reload.
- `match`=*`name`*

    specifies the `match` block configuring the tests that a
    response should pass in order for a health check to pass.
    By default, the response should have status code 2xx or 3xx.
- `port`=*`number`*

    defines the port used when connecting to a server
    to perform a health check (1.9.7).
    By default, equals the
    [`server`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#server) port.
- `type`=`grpc`
[`grpc_service`=*`name`*]
[`grpc_status`=*`code`*]

    enables periodic
    [health checks](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md#grpc-health-checking-protocol) of a gRPC server
    or a particular gRPC service specified with the optional
    `grpc_service` parameter (1.19.5).
    If the server does not support the gRPC Health Checking Protocol,
    the optional `grpc_status` parameter can be used
    to specify non-zero gRPC
    [status](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md#status-codes-and-their-use-in-grpc)
    (for example,
    status code “`12`” / “`UNIMPLEMENTED`”)
    that will be treated as healthy:
    ```
    health_check mandatory type=grpc grpc_status=12;
    ```
    The `type`=`grpc` parameter
    must be specified after all other directive parameters,
    `grpc_service` and `grpc_status`
    must follow `type`=`grpc`.
    The parameter is not compatible with
    [`uri`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check_uri) or
    [`match`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_hc_module.html#health_check_match) parameters.
- `keepalive_time`=*`time`*

    enables [keepalive](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#keepalive)
    connections for health checks and specifies the time during which
    requests can be processed through one keepalive connection (1.21.7).
    By default keepalive connections are disabled.

## `match`

**Syntax:** *`name`* `{...}`

**Contexts:** `http`

Defines the named test set used to verify responses to health check requests.

The following items can be tested in a response:
- `status 200;`

    status is 200
- `status ! 500;`

    status is not 500
- `status 200 204;`

    status is 200 or 204
- `status ! 301 302;`

    status is neither 301 nor 302
- `status 200-399;`

    status is in the range from 200 to 399
- `status ! 400-599;`

    status is not in the range from 400 to 599
- `status 301-303 307;`

    status is either 301, 302, 303, or 307


- `header Content-Type = text/html;`

    header contains "Content-Type"
    with value `text/html`
- `header Content-Type != text/html;`

    header contains "Content-Type"
    with value other than `text/html`
- `header Connection ~ close;`

    header contains "Connection"
    with value matching regular expression `close`
- `header Connection !~ close;`

    header contains "Connection"
    with value not matching regular expression `close`
- `header Host;`

    header contains "Host"
- `header ! X-Accel-Redirect;`

    header lacks "X-Accel-Redirect"


- `body ~ "Welcome to nginx!";`

    body matches regular expression “`Welcome to nginx!`”
- `body !~ "Welcome to nginx!";`

    body does not match regular expression “`Welcome to nginx!`”


- `require`
                             *`$variable`*
                             `...;`

    all specified variables are not empty and not equal to “0” (1.15.9).

If several tests are specified,
the response matches only if it matches all tests.
> Only the first 256k of the response body are examined.

Examples:
```
# status is 200, content type is "text/html",
# and body contains "Welcome to nginx!"
match welcome {
    status 200;
    header Content-Type = text/html;
    body ~ "Welcome to nginx!";
}
```

```
# status is not one of 301, 302, 303, or 307, and header does not have "Refresh:"
match not_redirect {
    status ! 301-303 307;
    header ! Refresh;
}
```

```
# status ok and not in maintenance mode
match server_ok {
    status 200-399;
    body !~ "maintenance mode";
}
```

```
# status is 200 or 204
map $upstream_status $good_status {
    200 1;
    204 1;
}

match server_ok {
    require $good_status;
}
```
