{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is to migrate the [Configure NGINX App Protect with NGINX Ingress Controller]({{< ref "/nic/installation/integrations/app-protect-waf-v5/configuration.md" >}}) page.

As part of changing information architecture for the whole NGINX product portfolio, as much of the context for a specific product is kept within its own documentation set as possible.

This reduces the amount of "hops" a customer must take across documentation sets, and improves maintainability by reducing the drift that occurs when re-documenting something in multiple places.
