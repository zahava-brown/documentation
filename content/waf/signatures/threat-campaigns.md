{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is to act as a replacement for the existing [Updating App Protect Threat Campaigns ]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md#updating-app-protect-threat-campaigns" >}}) section in the Administration/Install guides.

Each document should fulfill one specific operation: people may not need information on how to update signatures immediately after installing NGINX App Protect WAF, so this decouples the information into somewhere easily findable.
