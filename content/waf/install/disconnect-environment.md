{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The term _disconnected environment_ has become the more commmon synonym for an air-gapped or offline installation. It follows the precedent set by NGINX Instance Manager: [Deploy in a disconnected environment -> Install the latest NGINX Instance Manager with a script (disconnected)]({{< ref "/nim/disconnected/offline-install-guide.md" >}}).

The design intention for this page is as a standalone page for the operating system specific installation use cases:

- [v4]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md#offline-installation" >}})
- [v5]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/admin-guide/install.md#air-gap-install-secure-offline-installation" >}})

Instead of having separate top level folders, differences between v4 and v5 will be denoted with whole page sections, tabs, or other unique signifiers.

This reduces the amount of duplicate content, which makes maintainability much simpler and the text more uniform.

With the full context of this section, the page is shorter, being concerned only with one specific method of installation.

This makes it easier to link to specific instructions, and ensures that the customer sees only the critical information they need.
